# RTL-and-SV-verification-practice

This repository records my solutions to digital design and verification problems from **multiple online platforms**, including:
- Nowcoder (牛客)
- ChipDev
- HDLBits
- LeetSV
- Other HDL/RTL problem sources

Each problem includes:
- **Verilog RTL solution** (synthesizable)
- **SystemVerilog testbench** (for local simulation & verification)
- Notes on design, edge cases, and debugging

The goal is to build a comprehensive, long-term learning record for RTL design and verification.
